# Site Reliability Engineering
### Concepts

  - [Linux](https://github.com/FernandoFH/SRE/Notas/Servidores_Linux.md)
  - [Git](https://github.com/FernandoFH/SRE/Notas/GitHub_Note.md)
  - [Fundamentos Arquitectura Software](https://github.com/FernandoFH/SRE/Notas/Fundamentos_Arquitectura_Software.md)

Topic | What to learn | Alternatives | Description
:------|:------|:------|:------:
Version Control | [Git](#Learn-git) | - | Version Control is used everywhere and Git is the leading version control technology
Programming | At least one [programming language](#programming) | None. Don't settle for learning only shell scripting  | Anyone who practice DevOps should know programming to some extent
Operating System | [Linux](#operating-systems) | Other distribution of Linux :D | Operating Systems is another must when it comes to DevOps
Protocols | DHCP, UDP, TCP, HTTP, SSH | Not as an alternative, you can simply learn later: NFS, NTP, FTP | Learn how these protocols work and what they are used for
Applications | Web Server, Load Balancer, Cache, Database | | Learn how they work and try out some implementations (e.g. MySQL for databases and httpd for web servers)
[System Design](https://github.com/bregman-arie/system-design-notebook) | Availability, Reliability, Scalability, Performance | Learn how to design infrastructure and systems


Topic | What to learn | Alternatives | Description
:------|:------|:------|:------:
Configuration Management and IaC | Ansible and Terraform | CM: Chef, Puppet and Salt. IaC: Pulumi and CloudFormation |
Cloud | Azure, AWS, GCP | - |
Containers | Podman and Kubernetes| Docker instead of Podman. Nomad instead of Kubernetes | 
CI/CD | Jenkins, GitHub Actions | Gitlab CI, Circle CI, Argo CD |
Logging and Dashboards | Elastic Stack, Report Portal, Grafana | Graylog, Splunk |
Monitoring | Prometheus | Nagios, Datadog |
